        <h2>Carrot Cake</h2>
        <p>This is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever made! It's so moist and flavorful and makes a large quantity
            of
            cake. Since I started making it, I have been hounded to make this cake time and time again. Frost with cream
            cheese frosting.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine grated carrots and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit for 1 hour, then stir in raisins.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 10-inch round cake pans.
                </li>
                <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl until light. Gradually beat in white sugar, oil, and vanilla. Stir in
                    pineapple.
                    Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl, then stir into egg mixture until
                    absorbed. Stir in carrot mixture and walnuts. Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool for
                    10
                    minutes before removing cake layers from the pans; let cool completely.</li>
